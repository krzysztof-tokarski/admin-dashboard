# vanilla admin-dashboard

Vanilla stack.

First implementation of CSS Grid, all previous projects were based solely on Flexbox.

First implementation of position properties.

Did not try to implement responsiveness for mobile devices as it wasn't a requirement in the curriculum. Considering the project has fairly big amount of elements I may eventually comeback to it to implement the responsiveness - it can be a decent challenge. 

I had difficulty implementing the fixed areas, but I have come up with adding these fairly late to the finish and believe that issues with the implementation could have been caused by not sufficient blueprint of the whole project.
